Teleport Cloud requires authenticating with a role that has [`impersonation`](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/impersonation/) rights and can create the `access-plugin` role and user. Log in with `tsh` with a user that has this role or has a role with these `allow` rules.

```
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: plugin-admin
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles:
      - access-plugin
      users:
      - access-plugin
    rules:
      - resources: ['roles']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']
      - resources: ['user']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']

```

Create a non-interactive bot `access-plugin` user and role.

```yaml
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
---
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']
```

  If you're using other plugins, you might want to create different users and roles for different plugins
