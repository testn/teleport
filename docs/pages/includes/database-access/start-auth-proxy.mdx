Download the latest version of Teleport for your platform from our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) and follow the
installation [instructions](../../installation.mdx).

Teleport requires a valid TLS certificate to operate and can fetch one automatically
using Let's Encrypt. We
will assume that you have configured DNS records for `teleport.example.com` and
`*.teleport.example.com` to point to the Teleport node.

Next, start the Teleport Auth and Proxy services:

```code
$ sudo teleport start
```
