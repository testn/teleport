We provide pre-built Docker images for every version of Teleport.

These images are hosted on quay.io. All tags under `quay.io/gravitational/teleport` [are Teleport Open Source images](https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport?tag=latest\&tab=tags).

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=\&type=edition\&offering=community) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide. We currently only offer Docker images for `x86_64` architectures.

The table below gives an idea of how our image naming scheme works. We offer images that
point to a static version of Teleport, as well as images that are automatically rebuilt
every night. These nightly images point to the latest version of Teleport from the
three most recent release branches. They are stable, and we recommend their use to
keep your Teleport installation up to date.

<table>
 <thead>
   <tr><td>Image name</td><td>Teleport version</td><td>Image automatically updated?</td><td>Image base</td></tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
   <tr><td>`(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)`</td><td>The latest version of Teleport Open Source (=version=)</td><td>Yes</td><td>[Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu)</td></tr>
   <tr><td>`quay.io/gravitational/teleport:(=teleport.version=)`</td><td>The version specified in the image's tag (i.e. (=teleport.version=))</td><td>No</td><td>[Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu)</td></tr> 
 </tbody>
</table>

For testing, we always recommend that you use the latest release version of Teleport, which is currently `(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)`.
