<Admonition type="tip" title="Insecure Certificate Error">
  If you encounter an "Insecure Certificate Error" (or equivalent warning) that prevents the Teleport Web UI from opening, you can:

  1. Open the URL in Safari or Firefox.
  2. In Chrome, visit `chrome://flags` and enable "Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost."

  Both options will allow you to open the Web UI.
