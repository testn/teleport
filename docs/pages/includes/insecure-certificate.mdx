  If you encounter an "Insecure Certificate Error" (or equivalent warning) that prevents the Teleport Web UI from opening, you can perform one of the following actions depending on your browser:

  - In Safari's "This Connection Is Not Private" page, click "Show Details," then click "visit this website."
  - In Firefox, click "Advanced" from the warning page, then click "Accept the Risk and Continue."
  - In Chrome's warning page, type `thisisunsafe` to ignore certificate validation for the Teleport Web UI.
