# Getting Started

In this guide we will connect an Active Directory domain to Teleport using
Desktop Access and log into a Windows desktop from that domain.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires you to have:

- An Active Directory domain, configured for LDAPS (Teleport requires an
  encrypted LDAP connection)
- Access to a Domain Controller
- An existing Teleport cluster and user, version 8.0 or newer
  - See [Teleport Getting Started](../getting-started.mdx) if you're new to Teleport
- A Linux server to run the Teleport Desktop Access service on
  - You can reuse an existing server running any other Teleport instance

## Step 1/6. Create a restrictive service account

Teleport requires a service account to connect to your Active Directory domain.
We recommend creating a dedicated service account with restrictive permissions
for maximum security.

To create the service account, open a PowerShell prompt and copy-paste in the
commands below. A password for this service account will be randomly generated,
but immediately discarded. Teleport does not need this password, as it uses x509
certificates for LDAP authentication. You can reset the password for this
account should you need to perform password authentication.

```powershell
$Name="Teleport Service Account"
$SamAccountName="svc-teleport"

# Generate a random password that meets the "Password must meet complexity requirements" security policy setting.
# Note: if the minimum complexity requirements have been changed from the Windows default, this part of the script may need to be modified.
Add-Type -AssemblyName 'System.Web'
do {
   $Password=[System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(15,1)
} until ($Password -match '\d')
$SecureStringPassword=ConvertTo-SecureString $Password -AsPlainText -Force

New-ADUser `
  -Name $Name `
  -SamAccountName $SamAccountName `
  -AccountPassword $SecureStringPassword `
  -Enabled $true
```

Next, in the same PowerShell prompt, enter the following commands to limit your
service account's permissions.

```powershell
# Save your domain's distinguished name to a variable.
$DomainDN=$((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)

# Create the CDP/Teleport container.
# If the command fails with "New-ADObject : An attempt was made to add an object to the directory with a name that is already in use",
# it means the object already exists and you can move on to the next step.
New-ADObject -Name "Teleport" -Type "container" -Path "CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN"

# Gives Teleport the ability to create LDAP containers in the CDP container.
dsacls "CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):CC;container;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to create and delete cRLDistributionPoint objects in the CDP/Teleport container.
dsacls "CN=Teleport,CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):CCDC;cRLDistributionPoint;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to write the certificateRevocationList property in the CDP/Teleport container.
dsacls "CN=Teleport,CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN " /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):WP;certificateRevocationList;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to create and delete certificationAuthority objects in the NTAuthCertificates container.
dsacls "CN=NTAuthCertificates,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):CCDC;certificationAuthority;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to write the cACertificate property in the NTAuthCertificates container.
dsacls "CN=NTAuthCertificates,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):WP;cACertificate;"

```

## Step 2/6. Prevent the service account from performing interactive logins

<Admonition type="note" title="gpupdate.exe">
  Throughout this step and the next one, you will be modifying GPOs, and
  sometimes GPO modifications can take some time to propagate to all hosts. You
  can force your changes to take effect immediately on your current host at any
  time by opening a PowerShell prompt and running `gpupdate.exe /force` (though
  their effects may still take time to propagate to other machines on the
  domain).
</Admonition>

The Teleport service account is only needed to authenticate over LDAP, meaning
that it needn't be able to login to Windows machines like an ordinary user.
Restrict it from doing so by creating a new Group Policy Object (GPO) linked to
your entire domain, and then deny it interactive login.

### Create a GPO

1. Open a PowerShell prompt and change the `$GPOName` variable below to your
   desired GPO name, or leave the recommended name:

```powershell
$GPOName="Block teleport-svc Interactive Login"
```

2. Create the new GPO by running (from the same prompt):

```powershell
New-GPO -Name $GPOName | New-GPLink -Target $((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)
```

### Deny interactive login

1. Open the program named `Group Policy Management` and find the GPO you just
   created
   (`$FOREST > Domains > $DOMAIN > Group Policy Objects > Block teleport-svc Interactive Login`),
   right-click on it and select `Edit...` from the context menu.
2. Select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment
```

3. Double click `Deny log on locally` and in the popup, check `Define these policy settings`.
4. Then click `Add User or Group...`, `Browse ...`, enter the SAM account name
   of the user you created above (`svc-teleport`) and hit `Check Names` select
   your Group, and then hit `OK` on all the windows.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for `Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services` (in
   lieu of `Deny log on locally`).

## Step 3/6: Configure a GPO to allow Teleport connections

Next, we need to configure a GPO to allow Teleport desktop sessions. This
includes telling your computers to trust Teleport's CA, allowing the
certificate-based smart card authentication, and ensuring RDP is enabled.

### Export the Teleport CA

<Admonition type="note" title="Requires Existing Cluster">
  The following step requires an existing cluster. If you don't already have a
  Teleport cluster up and running, see our general [Getting
  Started](../getting-started.mdx) guide.
</Admonition>

1. Get the Teleport user CA certificate by running:

```
$ tctl auth export --type=windows > user-ca.cer
```

2. Transfer the `user-ca.cer` file to a Windows machine where you can manage your group policy.

### Create another GPO and import the Teleport CA

<Admonition type="note" title="Domain Wide Policy">
  For the purposes of this guide, we apply the GPO we are about to create to our
  entire AD domain. In the case where you wish for only a subset of computers
  within your AD domain to be accessible via Teleport, you should apply the GPO
  to an OU that includes only such computers.
</Admonition>

1. Create another new GPO, this time giving it a name like `Teleport Access Policy`:

```powershell
$GPOName="Teleport Access Policy"
New-GPO -Name $GPOName | New-GPLink -Target $((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)
```

2. Again open the `Group Policy Management` program, and on the left pane,
   navigate to `$FOREST > Domains > $DOMAIN > Group Policy Objects`.
3. Right click on the GPO you just made (`Teleport Access Policy`), and select `Edit...`.
4. In the group policy editor, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Public Key Policies
```

5. Right click on `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` and select `Import`.
6. Click through the wizard, selecting your CA file.

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Import Teleport CA">
  ![Import Teleport CA](../../img/desktop-access/ca.png)
</Figure>

### Publish the Teleport CA to the NTAuth Store

In order for authentication with Teleport-issued certificates to succeed, the
Teleport CA needs to be published to the enterprise NTAuth store. Teleport will
periodically publish its CA after it is able to authenticate, but this step
needs to be performed manually the first time in order for Teleport to have LDAP
access.

1. Publish the CA to LDAP:

```
$ certutil –dspublish –f <PathToCertFile.cer> NTAuthCA
```

2. Force the retrieval of the CA from LDAP. While this step is not required, it
   speeds up the process and allows you to proceed to the next steps without
   waiting for the certificate to propagate.

```
$ certutil -pulse
```

### Enable the Smart Card service

Teleport performs certificate based authentication by emulating a smart card.

1. Still editing your `Teleport Access Policy`, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > System Services
```

2. Double click on `Smart Card`, select `Define this policy setting` and switch
   to `Automatic` then click `OK`.

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Enable the Smart Card Service">
  ![Enable Smartcard](../../img/desktop-access/smartcard.png)
</Figure>

### Open firewall to inbound RDP connections

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  During testing on a Windows Server 2012 R2 server, we found that the following
  firewall rule would sometimes mysteriously dissapear. If connections through
  Teleport later appear to be hanging for a few seconds and then failing, double
  check that this rule is still in effect.
</Admonition>

1. Select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Windows Firewall with Advanced Security (x2)
```

2. Right click on `Inbound Rules` and select `New Rule...`.
3. Under `Predefined` select `Remote Desktop`.
4. Only select the rule for `User Mode (TCP-in)`.
5. On the next screen, select `Allow the connection` and finish.

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Open the Firewall">
  ![Open the Firewall](../../img/desktop-access/firewall.png)
</Figure>

### Allow remote RDP connections

1. Next, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Connections
```

2. Right click on `Allow users to connect remotely by using Remote Desktop Services` and select `Edit`. Select `Enabled` and `OK`.
3. Select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security
```

4. Right click `Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication`, edit, select **`Disable`** and `OK`.

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Disable Require user authentication...">
  ![Disable Require](../../img/desktop-access/disable.png)
</Figure>

### Ensure your GPO is updated

If you have not done so already, ensure your GPO is updated by opening a PowerShell prompt and running:

```powershell
gpupdate.exe /force
```

## Step 4/6. Export your LDAP CA certificate

Teleport connects to your Domain Controller via LDAPS. This means that you must
let Teleport know that the certificate sent by your Domain Controller during the
initial SSL connection is trusted. If your Domain Controller's certificate is
trusted by the system repository on the system running Teleport, you can skip
this step.

<Details title="Skipping TLS Verification">
  If you are unable to acquire the LDAP CA certificate, you can skip
  TLS verification by setting `insecure_skip_verify: true`. We do not recommend
  skipping TLS verification in production environments.
</Details>

### To export a CA certificate

{/* Adapted from https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/rds/5.2.1?topic=security-exporting-certificate-from-active-directory-server */}

1. Begin by navigating to `Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Certificate Authority` to open the CA Microsoft Management Console (MMC) GUI.
2. Right click on your CA computer and select `Properties`.
3. From `General` tab, click `View Certificate`.
4. Select the `Details` view and click `Copy to File`.
5. Click `Next` in the Certificate Export Wizard, and ensure that `DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)` is selected
6. Select a name and location for you certificate and click through the wizard.

Now transfer the exported file to the system where you're running Teleport. You
can either add this certificate to your system's trusted repository or provide
the filepath to the `der_ca_file` configuration variable.

## Step 5/6. Configure Teleport

<Admonition type="note" title="Teleport CA">
  Prior to v8.0, the Teleport CA was not compatible with Windows logins. If
  you're setting up Desktop Access in an existing cluster created before v8.0,
  you must first perform a [CA rotation](../setup/operations/ca-rotation.mdx) in
  order to resolve this.
</Admonition>

In order to enable Desktop Access in Teleport, add the following section in
`teleport.yaml` on your Linux server. For a detailed description of these
configuration fields, see the [reference](./reference.mdx) page.

```yaml
windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:3028"
  ldap:
    addr: "$LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS"
    domain: "$LDAP_DOMAIN_NAME"
    username: '$LDAP_USERNAME'
    # This should be the path to the certificate exported in Step 4.
    der_ca_file: /path/to/cert
  discovery:
    base_dn: "*"
```

After updating `teleport.yaml`, start Teleport as usual using `teleport start`.

## Step 6/6. Log in using Teleport

### Create a Teleport user/role for Windows Desktop Access

In order to gain access to a remote desktop, a Teleport user needs to have the
appropriate permissions for that desktop. For example, you can create a role
that gives its users access to all Windows desktop labels and the
`"Administrator"` user:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: windows-desktop-admins
spec:
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      "*": "*"
    windows_desktop_logins: ["Administrator"]
```

See the [RBAC section](./reference.mdx#rbac) in the Reference documentation
for more information about setting up Windows Desktop Access permissions.

See the [Access Controls Getting Started](../access-controls/getting-started.mdx#step-13-add-local-users-with-preset-roles)
guide for instructions on how to create or update a user with a given role.

### Connect to your Windows desktop

At this point everything is ready for Desktop Access connections. Open
the Teleport web UI and log in with a user with the role created above.

On the left pane, select `Desktops (preview)`. You should see the list of all
computers and Domain Controllers connected to your domain. Select one and click
`CONNECT` on the right, selecting one of the available logins:

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Select Desktop">
  ![Select Desktop](../../img/desktop-access/select-desktop.png)
</Figure>

A new tab will open and, after a few seconds, you should be logged in to your
target Windows host.
